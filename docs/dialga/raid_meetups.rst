Raid Meetups
************

.. contents:: :local:

Using dialga, you can create meetups for all raids that are level 4 or higher. Lower levels do not need this functionality as can be completed solo, or need at most 2 people. 
All the current raids that can have a meetup created can be found in the ``-activeraids channel``. This channel will show you all the current level 4+ raids, and also any meetups that have already been organised.

To attend or create meetups, commands must be posted in the ``-raidchat`` channel.

.. note::

	To create a meetup, you need the ID of the raid in the ``-activeraids`` channel. To attend a meetup, you need the ID of the meetup in the same channel.
